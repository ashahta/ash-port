          <p>
            After working within a varied range of industries for the past decade,
            taking a brief break to focus on my mental health, and pivoting into
            my new career path as a full-stack web developer, I am a recent
            newcomer into the tech industry: Fresh, enthusiastic, and ready to
            grow within an exciting and ever-shifting industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ready to uplift and encourage others with similar experiences as
            myself. Ready to grow and learn new technologies as they develop. And
            with the skills I've gained (and will continue to gain) ready to be
            able to make a difference in the areas that I am most passionate about
            - namely Intersectional diversity, and Women and Pasifika in tech.
